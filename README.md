# Insight

A privacy-friendly, low-volume, server-side analytics system.


## Description

Insight is a simple server-side analytics system designed for low volume websites that want a quick and easy way to learn about usage trends. Unlike other analytics systems, Insight doesn't monitor user activity directly. Instead, it records page loads on the server side. This is better both for reliability and user privacy.


## Features

### Simple

Insight is extremely simple to use. Just import the analytics script somewhere on each page you want to track, and Insight handles the rest!

### Efficient

Since Insight is completely server side, it has no perceivable effect on page loading times.

### Lightweight

Insight is completely purpose built, with minimal styling and no active UI elements. This makes it extremely lightweight and fast.

### Self Hosted

Insight is 100% self hosted, and doesn't need a connection to the internet to function.

### Private

Insight is designed to be as private as possible, both for users and administrators.

### Customizable

Insight uses a centralized configuration file to make adjustments and modifications quick and easy.
